### Common Example Commands

#### Building the executable

This is the command to build the binary executable if in developer mode or using the source install method ([requires crystal](INSTALL.md#source-install)):

```
crystal build src/cnf-testsuite.cr
```

#### Validating a cnf-testsuite.yml file:

```
./cnf-testsuite validate_config cnf-config=[PATH_TO]/cnf-testsuite.yml
```

#### Running all of the platform and workload tests:

```
./cnf-testsuite all cnf-config=<path_to_your_config_file>/cnf-testsuite.yml
```

#### Running all of the tests (including proofs of concepts)

```
./cnf-testsuite all poc cnf-config=<path_to_your_config_file>/cnf-testsuite.yml
```

#### Running all of the workload tests

```
crystal src/cnf-testsuite.cr workload
cnf-config=<path_to_your_config_file>/cnf-testsuite.yml
```

#### Running all of the platform or workload tests independently:

##### Run workload only tests:

```
./cnf-testsuite workload
```

##### Run platform only tests (long running):

```
./cnf-testsuite platform
```

#### Get available options and to see all available tests from command line:

```
./cnf-testsuite help
```

#### Clean up the CNF Test Suite, the K8s cluster, and upstream projects:

```
./cnf-testsuite cleanup
```

---

### Logging Options

#### Update the loglevel from command line:

```
# cmd line
./cnf-testsuite -l debug test
```

#### If in developer mode, make sure to use - - if running from source:

```
crystal src/cnf-testsuite.cr -- -l debug test
```

#### You can also use env var for logging:

```
LOGLEVEL=DEBUG ./cnf-testsuite test
```

:star: Note: When setting log level, the following is the order of precedence:

1. CLI or Command line flag
2. Environment variable
3. CNF-Testsuite [Config file](config.yml)

##### Verbose Option

Also setting the verbose option for many tasks will add extra output to help with debugging

```
./cnf-testsuite test_name verbose
```

#### Running The Linter in Developer Mode

See https://github.com/crystal-ameba/ameba for more details. Follow the [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) guide starting at the [Source Install](INSTALL.md#source-install) for more details running cnf-testsuite in developer mode.

```
shards install # only for first install
crystal bin/ameba.cr
```

### Workload Tests

#### Compatibility, Installability, and Upgradability Tests

##### :heavy_check_mark: To run all of the compatibility tests

```
./cnf-testsuite compatibility
```

##### :heavy_check_mark: To test the [increasing and decreasing of capacity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#scaling-resources)

<details> <summary>Details for increasing and decreasing of capacity</summary>
<p>

<b>increase_decrease_capacity test:</b> HPA (horizonal pod autoscale) will autoscale replicas to accommodate when there is an increase of CPU, memory or other configured metrics to prevent disruption by allowing more requests 
by balancing out the utilisation across all of the pods.

Decreasing replicas works the same as increase but rather scale down the number of replicas when the traffic decreases to the number of pods that can handle the requests.

You can read more about horizonal pod autoscaling to create replicas [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/).

<b>Remediation for failing this test:</b>

Check out the kubectl docs for how to [manually scale your cnf.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#scaling-resources)

Also here is some info about [things that could cause failures.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#failed-deployment)

</p>
</details>

##### To run the increase_capacity test individually:

```
./cnf-testsuite increase_capacity
```

##### To run the decrease_capacity test individually:

```
./cnf-testsuite decrease_capacity
```

##### To run both increase and decrease tests, you can use the alias command that calls them both:
```
./cnf-testsuite increase_decrease_capacity
```

##### :heavy_check_mark: Test if the Helm chart is published

##### :heavy_check_mark: Test if the [Helm chart is valid](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing)

```
./cnf-testsuite helm_chart_valid
```

##### :heavy_check_mark: Test if the Helm deploys

Use a cnf-testsuite.yml to manually call helm_deploy, e.g.:
Copy your CNF into the `cnfs` directory:

```
cp -rf <your-cnf-directory> cnfs/<your-cnf-directory>
```

Now run the test:

```

##### :heavy_check_mark: To check if the CNF is compatible with different CNIs
<details> <summary>Details for CNI Compatibility Tests</summary>

<p><b>CNI Compatible Tests:</b> Best practice states a good CNF should be compatible with multiple and different CNIs (Cloud Container Interface). The CNI handles the container network for the container network namespace, along with management of IP Addresses through IPAM plug-in among other networking needs and requirements. You can read more about CNIs for kubernetes with a list of CNIs for use [here](https://bit.ly/cni-compatible-k8s-doc)

<b>What's Tested:</b> This test will install temporary kind clusters to test your CNF using Calico and Cilium CNIs.

<b>Remediation:</b> To mitigate this issue, make sure your CNF is compatible with Calico, Cilium and other available CNIs.

#### :heavy_check_mark: To check if the CNF exposes any of its containers as a service

<details> <summary>Details for the service discovery test</summary>
<p>

<b>Service discovery:</b> For microservices to be accessible to other applications in the cluster, they should be exposed via a Service.

<b>Remediation Steps:</b> Make sure the CNF exposes any of its containers as a Kubernetes Service. You can learn more about Kubernetes Service [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).
</p>

</details>

#### State Tests

##### :heavy_check_mark: To run all of the state tests

```
./cnf-testsuite state
```

##### :heavy_check_mark: To test if the CNF uses a volume host path

```
./cnf-testsuite volume_hostpath_not_found
```

##### :heavy_check_mark: To test if the CNF uses local storage

```
./cnf-testsuite no_local_volume_configuration
```

##### :heavy_check_mark: To test if the CNF uses elastic volumes
<details> <summary>Details for elastic volume</summary>
<p>

<b>Elastic Volume Details:</b> It's considered best practice to use elastic volumes for storage. Instead of local storage, the CNF should use elastic persistent volumes, which are available to all nodes (based on policy).

<b>Remediation Steps:</b> Setup and use elastic persistent volumes instead of local storage.
</p>

</details>


```
./cnf-testsuite elastic_volume
```
##### :heavy_check_mark: To test if the CNF uses a database with either statefulsets, elastic volumes, or both
<details> <summary>Details for Database Persistence</summary>

<p><b>Database Persistence:</b> A database may use statefulsets along with elastic volumes to achieve a high level of resiliency.  Any database in K8s should at least use elastic volumes to achieve a minimum level of resilience regardless of whether a statefulset is used.  Statefulsets without elastic volumes is not recommended, especially if it explicitly uses local storage.  The least optimal storage configuration for a database managed by K8s is local storage and no statefulsets, as this is not tolerant to node failure. 

<b>Remediation:</b> Select a database configuration that uses statefulsets and elastic storage volumes.

##### :heavy_check_mark: Test if the CNF crashes when network latency occurs

<details> <summary>Details for litmus pod network latency experiment</summary>
<p>

<b>Pod Network Latency:</b> As we know network latency can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the application the network outages can cause a range of failures for applications that can severely impact user/customers with downtime. This chaos experiment allows you to see the impact of latency traffic to your application using the traffic control (tc) process with netem rules to add egress delays and test how your service behaves when you are unable to reach one of your dependencies, internal or external.

[This experiment](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/pod-network-latency/) causes network degradation without the pod being marked unhealthy/unworthy of traffic by kube-proxy (unless you have a liveness probe of sorts that measures latency and restarts/crashes the container). The idea of this experiment is to simulate issues within your pod network OR microservice communication across services in different availability zones/regions etc.

Mitigation (in this case keep the timeout i.e., access latency low) could be via some middleware that can switch traffic based on some SLOs m parameters. If such an arrangement is not available the next best thing would be to verify if such degradation is highlighted via notification/alerts etc, so the admin/SRE has the opportunity to investigate and fix things. Another utility of the test would be to see the extent of impact caused to the end-user OR the last point in the app stack on account of degradation in access to a downstream/dependent microservice. Whether it is acceptable OR breaks the system to an unacceptable degree. The experiment provides DESTINATION_IPS or DESTINATION_HOSTS so that you can control the chaos against specific services within or outside the cluster.

The applications may stall or get corrupted while they wait endlessly for a packet. The experiment limits the impact (blast radius) to only the traffic you want to test by specifying IP addresses or application information. This experiment will help to improve the resilience of your services over time.

./cnf-testsuite pod_network_latency
```

##### :heavy_check_mark: Test if the CNF crashes when disk fill occurs

<details> <summary> Details for litmus disk fill experiment</summary>
<p>

<b>Disk-Fill(Stress-Chaos):</b> Disk Pressure is another very common and frequent scenario we find in Kubernetes applications that can result in the eviction of the application replica and impact its delivery. Such scenarios can still occur despite whatever availability aids K8s provides. These problems are generally referred to as "Noisy Neighbour" problems.

[Stressing the disk](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/categories/pods/disk-fill/) with continuous and heavy IO for example can cause degradation in reads written by other microservices that use this shared disk for example modern storage solutions for Kubernetes to use the concept of storage pools out of which virtual volumes/devices are carved out. Another issue is the amount of scratch space eaten up on a node which leads to the lack of space for newer containers to get scheduled (Kubernetes too gives up by applying an "eviction" taint like "disk-pressure") and causes a wholesale movement of all pods to other nodes. Similarly with CPU chaos, by injecting a rogue process into a target container, we starve the main microservice process (typically PID 1) of the resources allocated to it (where limits are defined) causing slowness in application traffic or in other cases unrestrained use can cause the node to exhaust resources leading to the eviction of all pods. So this category of chaos experiment helps to build the immunity on the application undergoing any such stress scenario.

</p>
</details>

```
./cnf-testsuite disk_fill
```

##### :heavy_check_mark: Test if the CNF crashes when pod delete occurs

<details> <summary>Details for litmus pod delete experiment</summary> 
<p>

<b>Pod Delete:</b> In a distributed system like Kubernetes, likely, your application replicas may not be sufficient to manage the traffic (indicated by SLIs) when some of the replicas are unavailable due to any failure (can be system or application) the application needs to meet the SLO(service level objectives) for this, we need to make sure that the applications have a minimum number of available replicas. One of the common application failures is when the pressure on other replicas increases then to how the horizontal pod autoscaler scales based on observed resource utilization and also how much PV mount takes time upon rescheduling. The other important aspects to test are the MTTR for the application replica, re-elections of leader or follower like in Kafka application the selection of broker leader, validating minimum quorum to run the application for example in applications like percona, resync/redistribution of data.

[This experiment](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/categories/pods/pod-delete/) helps to simulate such a scenario with forced/graceful pod failure on specific or random replicas of an application resource and checks the deployment sanity (replica availability & uninterrupted service) and recovery workflow of the application.

</p>
</details>

```
./cnf-testsuite pod_delete
```

##### :heavy_check_mark: Test if the CNF crashes when pod memory hog occurs

<details> <summary>Details for litmus pod memory hog experiment</summary>
<p>

Memory usage within containers is subject to various constraints in Kubernetes. If the limits are specified in their spec, exceeding them can cause termination of the container (due to OOMKill of the primary process, often pid 1) - the restart of the container by kubelet, subject to the policy specified. For containers with no limits placed, the memory usage is uninhibited until such time as the Node level OOM Behaviour takes over. In this case, containers on the node can be killed based on their oom_score and the QoS class a given pod belongs to (bestEffort ones are first to be targeted). This eval is extended to all pods running on the node - thereby causing a bigger blast radius. 

The [pod-memory hog](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/categories/pods/pod-memory-hog/) experiment launches a stress process within the target container - which can cause either the primary process in the container to be resource constrained in cases where the limits are enforced OR eat up available system memory on the node in cases where the limits are not specified. 

</p>
</details>


```
./cnf-testsuite pod_memory_hog
```

##### :heavy_check_mark: Test if the CNF crashes when pod io stress occurs

<details> <summary>Details for litmus pod io stress experiment</summary>
<p>

Sressing the disk with continuous and heavy IO can cause degradation in reads/ writes byt other microservices that use this shared disk.  For example modern storage solutions for Kubernetes use the concept of storage pools out of which virtual volumes/devices are carved out.  Another issue is the amount of scratch space eaten up on a node which leads to  the lack of space for newer containers to get scheduled (kubernetes too gives up by applying an "eviction" taint like "disk-pressure") and causes a wholesale movement of all pods to other nodes.

[This experiment](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/categories/pods/pod-io-stress/) is also useful in determining the performance of the storage device used.

##### :heavy_check_mark: To check if an attacker can use a [symlink](https://bit.ly/C0058_symlink_filesystem) for arbitrary host file system access
<details> <summary>Details for Symlink Filesystem Access</summary>

<p><b>CVE-2021-25741 Symlink Host Access:</b> A user may be able to create a container with subPath or subPathExpr volume mounts to access files & directories anywhere on the host filesystem. Following Kubernetes versions are affected: v1.22.0 - v1.22.1, v1.21.0 - v1.21.4, v1.20.0 - v1.20.10, version v1.19.14 and lower. This control checks the vulnerable versions and the actual usage of the subPath feature in all Pods in the cluster.

<b>Remediation:</b> To mitigate this vulnerability without upgrading kubelet, you can disable the VolumeSubpath feature gate on kubelet and kube-apiserver, or remove any existing Pods using subPath or subPathExpr feature.

<details> <summary>Details for ingress_egress_blocked test</summary>
<p>

<b>Ingress Egress Blocked: </b> Network policies control traffic flow between Pods, namespaces, and external IP addresses. By default, no network policies are applied to Pods or namespaces, resulting in unrestricted ingress and egress traffic within the Pod network. Pods become isolated through a network policy that applies to the Pod or the Pod‚Äôs namespace. Once a Pod is selected in a network policy, it rejects any connections that are not specifically allowed by any applicable policy object.Administrators should use a default policy selecting all Pods to deny all ingress and egress traffic and ensure any unselected Pods are isolated. Additional policies could then relax these restrictions for permissible connections.(For ARMO runtime needs to add exception). See more at [Armo's C-0030 doc on ingress egress blocked details](https://bit.ly/3bhT10s).

<b>Remediation Steps: </b> By default, you should disable or restrict Ingress and Egress traffic on all pods.

##### :heavy_check_mark: To check if there are any privileged containers

<details> <summary>Details for Privileged Containers</summary>

<p><b>Privileged Containers:</b> A privileged container is a container that has all the capabilities of the host machine, which lifts all the limitations regular containers have. This means that privileged containers can do almost every action that can be performed directly on the host. Attackers who gain access to a privileged container or have permissions to create a new privileged container (by using the compromised pod‚Äôs service account, for example), can get access to the host‚Äôs resources.
    
<b>Remediation:</b> Change the deployment and/or pod definition to unprivileged. The securityContext.privileged should be false.

##### :heavy_check_mark: To check for insecure capabilities
<details> <summary>Details for Insecure Capabilities</summary>

<p><b>Insecure Capabilities:</b> Giving insecure and unnecessary capabilities for a container can increase the impact of a container compromise.

This test checks against a [blacklist of insecure capabilities](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/polaris/blob/master/checks/insecureCapabilities.yaml).

<b>Remediation:</b> Remove all insecure capabilities which aren‚Äôt necessary for the container.

This test checks against a [blacklist of dangerous capabilities](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/polaris/blob/master/checks/dangerousCapabilities.yaml).

<b>Remediation:</b> Check and remove all unnecessary capabilities from the POD security context of the containers and use the exception mechanism to remove warnings where these capabilities are necessary.

##### :heavy_check_mark: To check if namespaces have network policies defined
<details> <summary>Details for Network Policies</summary>

<p><b>Network Policies:</b> There is a MITRE check that fails if there are no policies defined for a specific namespace (cluster internal networking).

If no network policy is defined, attackers who gain access to a single container may use it to probe the network. Lists namespaces in which no network policies are defined.
    
<b>Remediation:</b> Define network policies or use similar network protection mechanisms.

##### :heavy_check_mark: To check if containers are running with non-root user with non-root membership
<details> <summary>Details for Non Root Containers</summary>

<p><b>Non Root Containers:</b> Container engines allow containers to run applications as a non-root user with non-root group membership. Typically, this non-default setting is configured when the container image is built. . Alternatively, Kubernetes can load containers into a Pod with SecurityContext:runAsUser specifying a non-zero user. While the runAsUser directive effectively forces non-root execution at deployment, NSA and CISA encourage developers to build container applications to execute as a non-root user. Having non-root execution integrated at build time provides better assurance that applications will function correctly without root privileges.
    
<b>Remediation:</b> If your application does not need root privileges, make sure to define the runAsUser and runAsGroup under the PodSecurityContext to use user ID 1000 or higher, do not turn on allowPrivlegeEscalation bit and runAsNonRoot is true.

<details> <summary>Details for hostPID and hostIPC Privileges</summary>

<p><b>Host PID/IPC Privileges:</b> Containers should be as isolated as possible from the host machine. The hostPID and hostIPC fields in Kubernetes may excessively expose the host for potentially malicious actions.
    
<b>Remediation:</b> Apply least privilege principle and disable the hostPID and hostIPC fields unless strictly needed.

<p><b>Linux Hardening:</b> Check if there is AppArmor, Seccomp, SELinux or Capabilities are defined in the securityContext of container and pod. If none of these fields are defined for both the container and pod, alert.
    
<b>Remediation:</b> In order to reduce the attack surface, it is recommended to harden your application using security services such as SELinux¬Æ, AppArmor¬Æ, and seccomp. Starting from Kubernetes version 22, SELinux is enabled by default.

##### :heavy_check_mark: To check if containers have resource limits defined
<details> <summary>Details for Resource Policies</summary>

<p><b>Resource Policies:</b> CPU and memory resources should have a limit set for every container to prevent resource exhaustion.

Check for each container if there is a ‚Äòlimits‚Äô field defined. Check for each limitrange/resourcequota if there is a max/hard field defined, respectively.
    
<b>Remediation:</b> Define LimitRange and ResourceQuota policies to limit resource usage for namespaces or nodes.

<details> <summary>Details for Immutable File Systems</summary>

<p><b>Immutable Filesystems:</b> Mutable container filesystem can be abused to gain malicious code and data injection into containers. Use immutable (read-only) filesystem to limit potential attacks.

Checks whether the readOnlyRootFilesystem field in the SecurityContext is set to true.
    
<b>Remediation:</b> Set the filesystem of the container to read-only when possible. If the containers application needs to write into the filesystem, it is possible to mount secondary filesystems for specific directories where application require write access.

##### :heavy_check_mark: To check if containers have hostPath mounts
<details> <summary>Details for Hostpath Mounts</summary>

<p><b>Writable Hostpath Mounts:</b> Mounting host directory to the container can be abused to get access to sensitive data and gain persistence on the host machine.

hostPath volume mounts a directory or a file from the host to the container. Attackers who have permissions to create a new container in the cluster may create one with a writable hostPath volume and gain persistence on the underlying host. For example, the latter can be achieved by creating a cron job on the host.
    
<b>Remediation:</b> Refrain from using host path mount.

##### :heavy_check_mark: To check if [cluster admin is bound to a pod](https://bit.ly/C0035_cluster_admin)
<details> <summary>Details for Cluster Admin Binding</summary>

<p><b>Cluster Admin Binding:</b> Role-based access control (RBAC) is a key security feature in Kubernetes. RBAC can restrict the allowed actions of the various identities in the cluster. Cluster-admin is a built-in high privileged role in Kubernetes. Attackers who have permissions to create bindings and cluster-bindings in the cluster can create a binding to the cluster-admin ClusterRole or to other high privileges roles.

Check which subjects have cluster-admin RBAC permissions ‚Äì either by being bound to the cluster-admin clusterrole, or by having equivalent high privileges.

<b>Remediation:</b> You should apply least privilege principle. Make sure cluster admin permissions are granted only when it is absolutely necessary. Don't use subjects with high privileged permissions for daily operations.

##### :heavy_check_mark: To check if [the control plane is hardened](https://bit.ly/C0005_Control_Plane)
<details> <summary>Details for Control Plane Hardening</summary>

<p><b>Control Plane Hardening:</b> The control plane is the core of Kubernetes and gives users the ability to view containers, schedule new Pods, read Secrets, and execute commands in the cluster. Therefore, it should be protected. It is recommended to avoid control plane exposure to the Internet or to an untrusted network. The API server runs on ports 6443 and 8080. We recommend to block them in the firewall. Note that port 8080, when accessed through the local machine, does not require TLS encryption, and the requests bypass authentication and authorization modules.

Checks if the insecure-port flag is set (in case of cloud vendor hosted Kubernetes service this verification will not be effective).

<b>Remediation:</b> Set the insecure-port flag of the API server to zero.

##### :heavy_check_mark: To check if dashboard is exposed

<details> <summary>Details for platform:exposed_dashboard</summary>
<p>

<b>Exposed Dashboard:</b> If Kubernetes dashboard is exposed externally in Dashboard versions before 2.01, it will allow unauthenticated remote management of the cluster. By default, the dashboard exposes an internal endpoint (ClusterIP service). While the [NSA and CISA‚Äôs K8s Hardening guide](https://bit.ly/3zUimHR) does not directly address the dashboard exposure it does go over related areas like the Control plane API. See more details in Kubescape documentation: [C-0047 - Exposed dashboard](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/c-0047)

<b>Remediation for failing this test: </b>

Update dashboard version to v2.0.1 or above.
